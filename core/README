"Native*" types
===============

Short of finding a better name, these types wrap int, string, map, array to 
satisfy interface core.Astnode. 

There is also NativeUndefined (to represent javascript `undefined`, as nil
can't be used).

These types are absent from the original coffeescript implementation, as js is 
a much more dynamic language.

They are put here in a core/native package for 2 reasons:

1. core.ParseContext depends upon it,
2. it better separates the ast types from the original implementation in ast/
