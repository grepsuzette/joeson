✓ process all TODO
✓ merge raw/ and handcompiled/ into grammars/ package
✓ see if callbacks in grammars can be simplified further: yes but would need reflection
✓ put all 4 code is deprecated in json in 1 func
✓ clean up commented comments in imports
✓ NO it seems possible to get rid of the grammar arg in RankFromLines() and getRule()
     It won't do because need to pass a rank in that case 
✓ better way for Prefix(node) + node.ContentString(). Something like String(node)
✓ clarify GrammarFromLines, the last argument `grammar`. See NewJoeson()
✓ try putting lambda.go and colors.go in main package: won't do. lambda was moved to helpers/
✓ improve and clarify joeson_test.go
✓ parsectx review visibility of fields, e.g. SkipLog Debug Frames?
- document and maybe add selective options to choose what log category to print in both go and js
✓ inquiry gnode line 44, do we still have this 3rd arg caller? if not remove: YES necessary
✓ from GNode, remove CbBuilder, SkipCache, SkipLog and Debug and embed a ParseOptions instead
