The present PEG grammar uses different rules.
These notes concern the CFG grammar described at https://go.dev/ref/spec
They will help when porting rules over.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The syntax is specified using a variant of Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF):

Syntax      = { Production } .
Production  = production_name "=" [ Expression ] "." .
Expression  = Term { "|" Term } .
Term        = Factor { Factor } .
Factor      = production_name | token [ "â€¦" token ] | Group | Option | Repetition .
Group       = "(" Expression ")" .
Option      = "[" Expression "]" .
Repetition  = "{" Expression "}" .

Productions are expressions constructed from terms and the following
operators, in increasing precedence:

|   alternation
()  grouping
[]  option (0 or 1 times)
{}  repetition (0 to n times)
