nice if no need to __ between tokens in the grammar
how?

sourcecode -> tokenize -> parse
STEP0         STEP1       STEP2
?

S is non-comment non-space
s is space (\n\t \r)
C is comment

A file is like:
SsSsSsSsSsSsCCCsSsSs

This is nice but our grammar reads from a string or CodeStream right now.
While in that case we would like to read from a "token stream".

# Use https://pkg.go.dev/go/scanner?

"Package scanner implements a scanner for Go source text. It takes a []byte as
source which can then be tokenized through repeated calls to the Scan method."

So we could use Parse(*ParseContext) Ast, provided our ParseContext is prepared
using Scan.
