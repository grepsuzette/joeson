This is the `astnode` interface implementers, 
the building blocks to parse an arbitrary joeson 
grammar.

How to `withChildren()` an Astnode tree
=======================================

withChildren() is like a functional map applied to 
a tree of Astnodes. 

What is the node type of the tree?
It's very loose and blurred, they are 
parents for rules. The various Astnodes
have various structures for children. 

Nothing formal like children: in coffee.
Our GNode could have that (children). 
Or it may just be a requirement for interface Astnode.

Once we would have that, we could imagine using 
reflect... Yes it sucks.

-a:Choice
 |-b:Sequence
   |-c:Astnode

withChildren ch:Choice, 
    if ch.sequence.length == 1
        return ch.sequence[0] 
                  ^-- i.e. Astnode
